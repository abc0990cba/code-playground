---
### Task description.
Given the root of a binary tree, return the inorder traversal of its nodes' values.

---
### Examples:
- Example 1:
> Input: root = [1,null,2,3]
> Output: [1,3,2]

- Example 2:
> Input: root = []
> Output: []

- Example 3:
> Input: root = [1]
> Output: [1]
---
 
### Constraints:
The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 100].
-100 <= Node.val <= 100
 
Follow up: Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?
