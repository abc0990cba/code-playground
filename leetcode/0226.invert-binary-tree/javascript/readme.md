The time complexity of the provided code is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree.

The space complexity of the code is also O(n) in the worst case, corresponding to the height of the tree. This happens when the tree is skewed (i.e., each node has only one child). In this case, the height of the stack due to recursive calls is equal to the number of nodes. However, in the average case (a balanced tree), the space complexity would be O(log n), as the height of the tree would be logarithmic with respect to the number of nodes.
